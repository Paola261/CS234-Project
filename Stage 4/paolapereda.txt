Work Done for the last part of the Project-Stage 4:

- Created the Customer_GUI 
- Created the CustomerManager class
- Created the customers.csv file 
- Updated my classes on UML Diagram
- Updated arrows on UML Diagram
- We all came together the day before and day off the due date to fix errors and make sure everything was working correctly.
- I did have some trouble pushing and pulling from NetBeans that took more time than anticipated. Ended up pushing from my teammates and editing with 
their help.
