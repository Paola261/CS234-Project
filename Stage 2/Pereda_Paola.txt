Here will be the descriptions for my selected classes. 
Classes include: Product, Customer, Movie, Food and Beverage


Description of what I completed during this stage 2 was the UML Diagram for the classes of Product, Customer, Movie, Food & Beverage. The class product is a newly added class. I listed the attributes and the methods. I do believe that along the way I will add more since this will only be the starting point for my classes.
